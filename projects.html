                    We also incorporate the latest CDFI list from the CDFI Fund website as of June 17, 2024.

                <h2>EDA Analysis of Haiti HIV Patients</h2>
                <p>
                    We used patient-level data from an Electronic Medical Records (EMR) system to build a predictive model that determines 
                    whether an HIV patient will remain in active treatment or transition to inactive status within the next 28 days. 
                    To support this goal, we developed an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) dashboard to identify patterns among active (Actif in Haiti) 
                    and inactive (PIT in Haiti) patients. The dashboard provides stakeholders with interactive filtering options to explore these patterns 
                    and tailor insights to their specific needs.

                <p>
                    We developed a predictive dashboard using the best-performing model (XGBoost) based on its superior ROC score, indicating its ability to accurately distinguish between active and inactive HIV patients. 
                    The dashboard integrates seamlessly with the EMR SQL database, allowing healthcare providers to input an EMR ID and select an institution name to retrieve patient data automatically. 
                    It then predicts the probability of a patient becoming inactive within the next 28 days. Additionally, users can provide comments or concerns directly within the interface. 
                    This tool helps healthcare providers identify patients at the highest risk of treatment interruption, enabling timely interventions to improve outcomes.

                <h2>Addressing Boston's Housing Crisis: Analyzing the Potential of Luxury Real Estate Taxes</h2>
                <p>
                  This project explores how Boston's proposed luxury real estate transfer tax could generate significant revenue for affordable housing. Using 2022 property sales data, 
                  I analyzed the potential impact of a 2% tax on properties valued over $2 million and a 4% tax on those over $4 million. The results reveal that these measures could 
                  raise up to $93.3 million annually, helping to tackle the city's housing affordability challenges. Additionally, the analysis highlights the outsized role institutional 
                  investors play in driving up real estate prices and the importance of applying higher taxes to their transactions to create more equitable housing opportunities.

                <h2>The Environmental Cost of Private Jet Travel: Insights from Hanscom Field</h2>
                <p>
                  This project examines the environmental and social impacts of private jet travel, focusing on Hanscom Field, New England's largest private jet hub. 
                  Analyzing 18 months of flight data, I found that wealthy travelers, often taking short luxury flights, stand to benefit the most from the proposed airport expansion — a move that would triple Hanscom's capacity for private jets. 
                  Private jets pollute up to 20 times more per passenger than commercial flights, yet their owners contribute far less in taxes to support air safety and sustainability. This analysis advocates for halting private jet expansions, 
                  increasing taxes and fees on private jet travel to fund public transit, and promoting transparency in emissions reporting to address their disproportionate environmental impact.
